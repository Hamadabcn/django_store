Educational Academy project using Django:
1. What is required is to create a website for an educational academy. This academy works to sell its courses to students. Payment must be created using Stripe.

2. In the top menu there will be a drop-down list or two options next to each other, one for the Arabic language and the other for the English language. The user can switch between languages to change the language of the site. 

3. A control panel must be created through which the administrator can add new courses to the site.

4. Courses are closed to all users. After purchasing the course and the success of the purchase process, the course is opened only to the person who purchased it.

5. Within each course, you can put one video clip for the purpose of experimenting.

6. Below the video clip, you must create a section for comments and responses.

7. The site will contain a blog, which must be created with a separate app within the project.

8. The final project must be uploaded to one of the platforms so that we can preview it.

9. Anything not explained in the text is left to your imagination. You can add and implement anything you deem appropriate for the project.

10. The project implementation period is 15 days.
